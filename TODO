Don't segfault if .in files are missing.

Better way to handle config files:
    http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html
    sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev [got me] libconfig8 libconfig8-dev

Put in stuff for kinked or piecewise-linear optimum functions.

If command line options aren't valid variables, print a warning.

Error checking/reporting for num_species and the contents of alpha_file, initial_num, and initial_zbar.

Make sure all the variance parameters are positive.

With 1 cell and delta > 0, can get num < 0: bring back TINY?

If more species or cells are needed, malloc the space array.

Stop at equilibrium (define tol), rather than at pre-determined time.

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa) (should be okay as
long as phenotype distribution and competition function are symmetric -- see
C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about
relaxing weak competition assumption) 
[alpha matrix is done now]


For packaging versions:

svn export under_svn/ dist/EvoCompX-v0.x
cd dist/EvoCompX-v0.x
rm TODO
vi src/Makefile     # remove -g option from gcc
cd ..
tar czvf EvoCompX-v0.x.tar.gz EvoCompX-v0.x/
