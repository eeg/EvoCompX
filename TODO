need more in the README

comments from Walter:
	combine landscape and dispersal (?)
	GPL file and comments in each source file (gplify)
	svn export
	version number
	if more species or cells are needed, malloc the space array


For later:

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa)
   (should be okay as long as phenotype distribution and competition         function are symmetric -- see C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about relaxing weak competition assumption)
