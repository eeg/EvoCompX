Add alpha matrix input for diffuse competition.
   make_alpha.py  ->  alpha.in

Create CHANGES.
Increment version number.

Remove -g in dist/ ?

Make sure all the variance parameters are positive.

With 1 cell and delta > 0, can get num < 0: bring back TINY?

For later:

If more species or cells are needed, malloc the space array.

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa) (should be okay as
long as phenotype distribution and competition function are symmetric -- see
C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about
relaxing weak competition assumption)
