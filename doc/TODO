Had to remove -O2 from gcc in order to get rid of warn_unused_result messages

make UNDEF global?

Allow more than two species

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa)
   (should be okay as long as phenotype distribution and competition         function are symmetric -- see C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about relaxing weak competition assumption)
