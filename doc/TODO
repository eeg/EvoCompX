Had to remove -O2 from gcc in order to get rid of warn_unused_result messages

remove TINY (input.h, not used)
do record-keeping variables work?
	stop_t does

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa)
   (should be okay as long as phenotype distribution and competition         function are symmetric -- see C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about relaxing weak competition assumption) 


comments from Walter:
document data structures
combine landscape and dispersal
make UNDEF a more unique name
more helpful message when run without input
version number
GPL file and comments in each source file (gplize?)
move usage to README
svn export
