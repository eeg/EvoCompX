Had to remove -O2 from gcc in order to get rid of warn_unused_result messages

make UNDEF global?
	done: input.h
remove TINY (input.h, not used)
do record-keeping variables work?

Allow more than two species
	structure is there, just need to try it

Allow asymmetric competition (competition matrix or kappa)
   (should be okay as long as phenotype distribution and competition         function are symmetric -- see C&T below Eq13, response1.txt #11, lab book p10; or see Silwood notes about relaxing weak competition assumption)
